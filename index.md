### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 2 was a very memorable project for me because I loved using math to find the averages. Using math operators within code is one of my favorite things to do, so naturally this lab was very fun for me. I also had to debug the math on this project a couple times which added to the complexity.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to expand my knowledge in the creation of functions. We implemented the functions in this lab as well as coded the main .cc file. Not only did we get to code these files, but we also got to use more math within our code, which again, I enjoy very much.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite lab this semester! Though it is the simplest program that we have written, I always love coding hello world programs. Something about it being the first code that all programmers write makes it feel very euphoric to be able to create my own. This lab reminded me of my first ever hello world program that I wrote in javascript back in highschool.
